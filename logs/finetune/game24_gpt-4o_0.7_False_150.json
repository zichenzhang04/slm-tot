Add 13 and 13 to get 26.\n   - Remaining numbers: 11, 13, 26\n   - Calculation: 13 + 13 = 26\n\n2. Subtract 13 from 26 to get 13.\n   - Remaining numbers: 11, 13\n   - This path doesn't lead to 24, backtrack and try another path.\n\n \n### Conclusion\nAfter examining all available paths, it seems like the initial problem might not be solvable with the basic operations using the numbers provided. Please double-check for any missing operations or potential logical errors in the setup.\n\n### Answer\nIt appears there is no straightforward way to achieve 24 using the operations provided with the numbers 11, 13, 13, 13. If a solution exists, it may require alternative approaches that go beyond simple arithmetic operations without repeating numbers or similar constraints.",
