1 1 4 6
1 + 1 = 2 (left: 2 4 6)
2 + 4 = 6 (left: 6 6)
6 * 6 = 36 (left: 36)
1 + 1 = 2 (left: 2 4 6)
6 - 2 = 4 (left: 4 4)
4 * 4 = 16 (left: 16)
6 - 4 = 2 (left: 1 1 2)
1 + 2 = 3 (left: 1 3)
1 + 3 = 4 (left: 4)
1 + 4 = 5 (left: 1 5 6)
6 - 1 = 5 (left: 5 5)
5 * 5 = 25 (left: 25)
4 + 6 = 10 (left: 1 1 10)
1 + 1 = 2 (left: 2 10)
10 + 2 = 12 (left: 12)
4 + 6 = 10 (left: 1 1 10)
10 - 1 = 9 (left: 1 9)
9 * 1 = 9 (left: 9)

1 1 11 11
11 + 11 = 22 (left: 1 1 22)
22 + 1 = 23 (left: 1 23)
23 + 1 = 24 (left: 24)
Answer: ((11 + 11) + 1) + 1 = 24
