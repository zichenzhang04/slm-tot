Let's try another path:\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **13 - 1 = 12** (left: 4, 5, 12)\n2. **5 - 4 = 1** (left: 1, 12)\n3. **12 * 1 = 12** (left: 12)\n\nAfter numerous attempts and backtracking, trying to solve the input with the given numbers, it seems creating 24 directly with these specific numbers using basic arithmetic operations hasn't yielded a successful and straightforward solution. Let's review each possible combination and ensure all operations have been thoroughly tested.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **5 * 4 = 20** (left: 1, 13, 20)\n2. **20 + 1 = 21** (left: 13, 21)\n3. **21 + 13 = 34** (left: 34)\n\nAgain, this is not successful.

Let's try one more path:\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **5 + 4 = 9** (left: 1, 9, 13)\n2. **13 - 9 = 4** (left: 1, 4)\n3. **4 * 1 = 4** (left: 4)\n\nThis still doesn't work. Let's try once again:\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **4 * 5 = 20** (left: 1, 13, 20)\n2. **20 + 1 = 21** (left: 13, 21)\n3. **21 + 13 = 34** (left: 34)\n\nThis is not successful.

I apologize for the confusion and thank you for your patience."
